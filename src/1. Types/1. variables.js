// in types script we declare a variable by saying that this is string variable. and its always going to be string .
//  or its number and always a number . same with other data types
// =============================================================
//        1 . with string
// =============================================================
// We can give types to variables in typescripts like this
var myName = "Ak Nagar";
// we can redefine it with string 
myName = "Ashish";
// we can not redefine it with number that would be wrong like below example
// myName = 938 
// =============================================================
//                2.  with Numbers and booleans
// =============================================================
// same like strings we can also this with Numbers and booleans
// with number
var myNumber = 42; // it always going to be number now 
myNumber = 45;
// i can not redefine it again by making it string
// with booleans
var myBooleans = true;
// this boolean always going to be boolean
